# Skupina 14: Locally irregular edge colorings (Lokalno iregularno barvanje povezav)
Avtorja: Lara Jagodnik, Domen Flakus Bosilj

## Kratek opis problema

An edge coloring of a graph is *locally irregular* if for very edge *uv* colored by some color *c*, the number of edges at *u* colored by *c* is different from the number of edges at *v* colored by *c*. In other words, every color induces a graph in which that no two adjacent vertices are of the same degree.

We would like to test the following conjecture, possibly to disprove it:
    ***Every cubic graph is locally irregular 3-edge-colorable.***
